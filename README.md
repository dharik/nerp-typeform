# Ideas

* Expiring surveys or surveys with public results
  * Add expires_at, public_at
  * If user wants it to expire, just set expires_at. Then no more responses accepted
  after that date
  * If user wants it to be public, set public_at. After then, responses can be
  made public
  * Similarly, add starts_at to limit when responses can begin. Or public_until to limit
  how long responses are public for

* My surveys (via login)
  * Add _users_surveys join table
